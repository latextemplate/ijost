It should be understandable to colleagues from a broad range of scientific disciplines. Organization and citation of the bibliography are made in Vancouver style in sign, and so on. The terms in foreign languages are written italic (italic)\citep{awangga2018sampeu}. The text should be divided into sections, each with a separate heading and numbered consecutively. The section/subsection headings should be typed on a separate line, e.g., 1. Introduction .
